# Templates

The `templates/` folder is where you should override or create any theme files you need.

**Templates** should be placed inside folders by entity type such as `node` and `paragraph`.

Example: 
```
  templates
    base
      html.html.twig
      page.html.twig
    node
      node--article--full.html.twig
      node--event--teaser.html.twig
    paragraph
      paragraph.html.twig
      paragraph--hero--default.html.twig
```
