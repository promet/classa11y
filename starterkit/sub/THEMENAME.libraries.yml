# Library naming structure
#
# library--{library-name}
#   Use library naming structure for external libraries that will then be used as dependencies of other libraries.
#
# component--{component-name}
#   Use component naming structure for reusable items that aren't necessarily entity-specific. Include these as
#   dependencies on the entity-specific libraries.
#
# {entity-type}--{view-mode}
# {entity-type}--{view-mode}--{bundle}
#   Use entity naming structure to allow the entities to automatically attach styles when rendered.
#
# NOTE: Entity CSS and JS files that are included in multiple different entity-specific libraries, should probably be
#       broken into the component structure listed above and added as a dependency on the entity-specific library.
